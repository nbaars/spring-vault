/**
 * Interface that specifies PKI backend-related operations.

 * The PKI secret backend for Vault generates X.509 certificates dynamically based on
 * configured roles. This means services can get certificates needed for both client and
 * server authentication without going through the usual manual process of generating a
 * private key and CSR, submitting to a CA, and waiting for a verification and signing
 * process to complete. Vault's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms
 * provide the verification functionality.
